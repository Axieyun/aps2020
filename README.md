This is the code for the paper 'Variable Selection with Copula Entropy' accepted by Chinese Journal of Applied Probability and Statistics. The preprint paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12389) on ArXiv.

In the paper, three methods for variable selection are compared on the UCI [heart disease data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease):
* Copula Entropy,
* Hilbert-Schimdt Independence Criterion (HSIC),
* Distance Correlation.

 Three additional independence measures are also considered in this version of comparison experiment:
* Heller-Heller-Gorfine Tests of Independence,
* Hoeffding's D test,
* Bergsma-Dassios T* sign covariance.
